# H-1B Employer Data Hub

By : Joshua Song / Bennet Tefu / Sunny Kim / Yeabsira Gebreegziabher 

## Project Overview
H-1B Visa is a nonimmigrant visa that allows U.S. employers to hire foreigners for jobs that require a bachelorâ€™s degree or equivalent. We aim to create a project that acts as a data hub of H-1B statistics from 2018 to 2022. The project will provide a clear presentation of data and helpful features to aid the user!
 
## Data Summary
Our dataset contains the relevant records of H-1B Visa for numerous companies that apply on behalf of non-US citizens in the United States. The CSV file is arranged by fiscal year, employer name, initial approval, initial denial, continuing approval, continuing denial, NAICS (North American Industry Classification System Code), Tax ID, State, City, and ZIP. The link below is the link we used to download all the files and find descriptions of the dataset.

### Data Processing
1. Downloaded data 
- FY 2022 H-1B Employer Data (CSV, 1.27 MB)
- FY 2021 H-1B Employer Data (CSV, 3.81 MB)
- FY 2020 H-1B Employer Data (CSV, 3.47 MB)
- FY 2019 H-1B Employer Data (CSV, 4.88 MB)
- FY 2018 H-1B Employer Data (CSV, 4.57 MB)

2. Customizing data for our project
- We will be merging / combining all five CSV files to create one big CSV file in order to upload it to our database. 

3. Sample Data
- We will be creating a short dummyData.csv file which contains a small part from all five databases just to save time during the process of running our code while developing.

## User Interaction

1. Input a name of a state as a variable and get an output of the list of all companies in the input state.
2. Input a name of a company as a variable and get an output of the list of all statistics(Fiscal Year, Initial Approval, Initial Denials, Continuing Approvals, Continuing Denials, NAICS, Tax ID, State, City, ZIP) related to the input company.
3. Input a number of approvals as a variable and get an output of the list of all companies with a minimum, maximum, initial, and current approvals of the input number.
4. List the top 10 companies and states with the highest percentage of visa approval.
5. A map that shows a list of companies in the state when clicking on the map.
